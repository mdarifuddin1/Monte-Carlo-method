Simulation & Modeling (Lab) work
Assignment 01

Problem Name :Do a Program on Random walk problem (Monte Carlo method) where the user will be able to take the associated probabilities of each direction 
Also, the user should be able to take the values for incrementation and decrementation values for each direction 
The starting position should also be taken as input from the user in Java program

Assigning random numbers to the directions should be done during compilation (not manually) 
 Selection of random numbers for each step should also be done during compilation (mot manually) 
The number of steps should be taken as input .

This my code

import random
import  math
def random_walk(n):
    x =0
    y =0
    for i in range(n):
        S = random.choice(['North','South','Eest','West']) # S for step
        if S =='North':  
            y = y+1
        elif S =='South':
            y = y-1
        elif S =='Eest':
            x = x+1
        else:
            x = x -1
    return (x,y)
A = int(input("Plase push the step: "))
B = int(input("Enter the value : "))
for i in range(A):
    walk = random_walk(B)
    print(walk,"Distance to every Step = ",abs(walk[0]) + abs(walk[1]))
